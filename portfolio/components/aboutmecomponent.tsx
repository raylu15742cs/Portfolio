                <p>Hello! My name is Raymond and I am trying to build a career in the world of web development. I have an economics background, which I value since it taught me to see the world in a logical way.</p>
                <p className="pt-1">My first taste of web development was when I decided to take an intro to computer science course based on python. It was one of the courses that I will never forget, and it definitely peaked my interest in the field. </p>
                <p className="pt-1">I decided to take the next step and start learning web development on my own. I started with the Odin Project, and I am currently working on the curriculum. I am also working on my Youtube channel where I will be posting videos on my journey. </p>
