            <div className="">
                <p>Hello! I am a self taught software engineer based in Pasadena, California. I have an economics background, which I value since it taught me to see the world in a logical way.</p>
                <p className="pt-1">My first taste of web development was when I decided to take an intro to computer science course based on python. It was one of the courses that I will never forget, and it definitely peaked my interest in the field. </p>
                <p className="pt-1">I decided to take the next step and start learning web development on my own. I started with the Odin Project, and I am currently building projects such as StudiBetter and Pokemon Memory Game. I am also working on my Youtube channel where I will be posting videos on my journey. </p>
                <p className="pt-1">My goal is to become a software engineer, and I am currently working on my skills in React, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python. I am also working on my skills in UI/UX design. </p>
                <p className="pt-1">Currently looking for a entry level software engineer position, and I am open to any opportunities.  </p>
                <p className="pt-5 text-center">Here are a few technologies that I currently am using: </p>
